- How many different types of tags we have?
    - We have 2 types of tags.
    #1- Paired tag:
        - Paired tags have 2 parts
        - <opening tag> and </closing tag>
        - the actual content goes in between the opening tag and closing tag
    #2- Un-paired tag:
        - These are self-closing tags.
        - They are just 1 part.
        - All of the information goes into the tag itself.
