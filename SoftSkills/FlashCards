1. SDLC
Software Development Life Cycle.

A formalized framework describing activities and steps to develop/build software.

SDLC Steps:

Requirement gathering

Designing

Developing / coding

Testing

Deploying / production

Maintaining

2. Requirement
A requirement is a specification of a business need that can include functions, behaviors, and qualities of a product, service, process, or practice.

The client/stakeholders provide requirements.

in agile, requirements are the user stories.

3. Software Testing
Process of verifying that a program functions properly, Evaluate the quality of the application by comparing expected and the actual result

4. Manual Testing
In Manual Testing, Testers manually execute test cases using manual testing tools. Both FrontEnd and Backend can be tested manually.

Manual testing:

● Manually testing software for defects;

● Tester plays the role of an end-user;

● Test all features to ensure the correct behavior.

When to conduct the Manual Testing?

● Expensive to do automation;

● Need for human judgment;

● Ongoing need for human intervention.

● Starting a project newly.

5. Verification
Human-based checking/testing of documents

Does NOT involve code or project

E.g. verify SRS doc, design doc, etc

6. Validation
Process of verifying the software and its features

Actual code and software execution

Computer-based testing the application (Automation )

Also, involve human-based testing the application(Manual)

7. software environment
Environments are the different versions of the software, and each env has a different purpose to use.

Dev Env, test Env, Staging Env, Production

http://dev.restaurant.com

http://qa.restaurant.com

http://stg.restaurant.com

https://restaurant.com

8. Dev Environment
Developers' workstation

Changes are made in this environment (new feature, bug fix, etc)

Unit & Integration testings are performed

After the tests are passed, the items are deployed/moved to one or more test environments.

example: http://dev.amazon.com

9. QA Environment
Tester's environment to test Functional & non-Functional parts of the app.

Smoke testing was also performed in the QA.

Regression testing - it depends. in QA or stg env

example: http://qa.amazon.com

10.Staging Environment
Another name is pre-production env.

A "production like" environment to run performance tests and test usability and features.term-48

most of the companies perform UAT testing in this env

After UAT passes, the application will be deployed to production.

example: http://stg.amazon.com

11. production Environment
The environment for the actual system operation. Also called the operational environment.

End-users use this env.

example: http://amazon.com
